## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js (for local development)

### Installation & Running (with Docker)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd stock-trading-app
   ```

2. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - Web UI: http://localhost
   - API: http://localhost/api
   
### Development Setup

#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scalability Considerations

This application is designed as a demo/prototype but could be scaled for production with the following enhancements:

- **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory storage with MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Add user authentication (JWT, OAuth)
- **Multiple Stocks**: Support for trading various stocks/assets
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Load balancing with multiple backend instances
- **Queue System**: RabbitMQ or Redis for trade processing
- **WebSocket Clustering**: Redis adapter for Socket.IO to handle multiple instances

## Future Improvements

- [ ] User authentication and accounts
- [ ] Transaction history
- [ ] Order types (limit, stop loss)
- [ ] News feed integration
- [ ] Mobile application (React Native)
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
